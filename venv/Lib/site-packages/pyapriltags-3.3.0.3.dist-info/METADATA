# pyapriltags: Python bindings for the Apriltags library

These are Python bindings for the [Apriltags 3](https://github.com/AprilRobotics/apriltags) library developed by [AprilRobotics](https://april.eecs.umich.edu/).
Inspired by the [Apriltags2 bindings](https://github.com/swatbotics/apriltag) by [Matt Zucker](https://github.com/mzucker).
Forked from [dt-apriltags](https://github.com/duckietown/lib-dt-apriltags).

The original library is published with a [BSD 2-Clause license](https://github.com/AprilRobotics/apriltag/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

## Installation

### The easy way
You can install using `pip` (or `pip3` for Python 3):
```
pip install pyapriltags
```

And if you want a particular release, add it like this:
```
pip install pyapriltags@v3.3.0
```

### Build it yourself

Clone this repository and navigate in it. Then initialize the Apriltags submodule:
```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

Build the Apriltags C library and embed the newly-built library into the pip wheel.
```
$ make build
```

The new wheel will be available in the directory `dist/`.
You can now install the wheel
```
pip install pyapriltags-VERSION-py3-none-ARCH.whl
```
NOTE: based on the current `VERSION` of this library and your OS, together with the architecture of your CPU `ARCH`, the filename above varies.


## Release wheels

All the wheels built inside `dist/` can be released (pushed to Pypi.org) by running the command
```
make upload
```


### Release all

Use the following command to build and release wheels for Python 3 and CPU architecture `amd64`, `aarch64` and `arm32v7`.
```
make release-all
```


## Usage

Some examples of usage can be seen in the `test.py` file.
The `Detector` class is a wrapper around the Apriltags functionality. You can initialize it as following:

```
at_detector = Detector(searchpath=['apriltags'],
                       families='tag36h11',
                       nthreads=1,
                       quad_decimate=1.0,
                       quad_sigma=0.0,
                       refine_edges=1,
                       decode_sharpening=0.25,
                       debug=0)
```

The options are:

| quad_decimate     	| 2.0           	| Detection of quads can be done on a lower-resolution image, improving speed at a cost of pose accuracy and a slight decrease in detection rate. Decoding the binary payload is still done at full resolution. Set this to 1.0 to use the full resolution.                                                                        	|

| refine_edges      	| 1             	| When non-zero, the edges of the each quad are adjusted to "snap to" strong gradients nearby. This is useful when decimation is employed, as it can increase the quality of the initial quad estimate substantially. Generally recommended to be on (1). Very computationally inexpensive.

| decode_sharpening 	| 0.25          	| How much sharpening should be done to decoded images? This can help decode small tags but may or may not help in odd lighting conditions or low light conditions                                                                                                                                                                 	|

Detection of tags in images is done by running the `detect` method of the detector:

```
tags = at_detector.detect(img, estimate_tag_pose=False, camera_params=None, tag_size=None)
```

If you also want to extract the tag pose, `estimate_tag_pose` should be set to `True` and `camera_params` (`[fx, fy, cx, cy]`) and `tag_size` (in meters) should be supplied. The `detect` method returns a list of `Detection` objects each having the following attributes (note that the ones with an asterisks are computed only if `estimate_tag_pose=True`):

| tag_id          	| The decoded ID of the tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	|
| hamming         	| How many error bits were corrected? Note: accepting large numbers of corrected errors leads to greatly increased false positive rates. NOTE: As of this implementation, the detector cannot detect tags with a Hamming distance greater than 2.                                                                                                                                                            	|
| decision_margin 	| A measure of the quality of the binary decoding process: the average difference between the intensity of a data bit versus the decision threshold. Higher numbers roughly indicate better decodes. This is a reasonable measure of detection accuracy only for very small tags-- not effective for larger tags (where we could have sampled anywhere within a bit cell and still gotten a good detection.) 	|
| homography      	| The 3x3 homography matrix describing the projection from an "ideal" tag (with corners at (-1,1), (1,1), (1,-1), and (-1, -1)) to pixels in the image.                                                                                                             	|

## Custom layouts

If you want to use a custom layout, you need to create the C source and header files for it and then build the library again. Then use the new `libapriltag.so` library. You can find more information on the original [Apriltags repository](https://github.com/AprilRobotics/apriltags).


## Developer notes

The wheel is built inside a Docker container. The Dockerfile in the root of this repository is a template for the build environment. The build environment is based on `ubuntu:latest` and python3 is installed on the fly.
The `make build` command will create the build environment if it does not exist before building the wheel.

Once the build environment (Docker image) is ready, a Docker container is launched with the following configuration:
- the root of this repository mounted to `/apriltag`;
- the directory `dist/` is mounted as destination directory under `/out`;

The building script from `assets/build.sh` will be executed inside the container. The build steps are:
- configure a cmake build in `/builds/<arch>` from the apriltag library from submodule `apriltags/`
- run cmake build
- copy so/.dylib/.dll library file to `/dist/<arch>` (inside the container)
- repeat above steps for: `win64`, `macos arm64`, `macos x86_64`, `linux x86_64`, `linux aarch64`, `linux armv7l`
- build python wheel (the .so library is embedded as `package_data`)
- copy wheel file to `/out` (will pop up in `dist/` outside the container)
